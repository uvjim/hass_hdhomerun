## Configurable Options

It is possible to configure the following options for the integration.

### Timeouts

![Configure Options](images/config_timeouts.png)

* `Scan Interval`: the frequency of updates for the sensors, default `300s`
* `Tuner status update`: the frequency of updates for tuners, default `10s`

### Options

![Configure Options](images/config_options.png)

* `Channel logo path` - the path to a directory containing channel logos,
  e.g. `/local/channel_logos`. The default is to have no logo. If previously
  set, you can clear this option by just entering a space

You can also select which format should be used for the sensor. The
default is `Channel name`.

_This setting is only effective when a tuner is actively tuned to a channel._

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Logging

Debug logging can be enabled in Home Assistant using the [`logger`
integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/).

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hdhomerun: debug
```

### Diagnostics Integration

Starting with Home Assistant 2022.2, a new diagnostics integration can be
used to provide troubleshooting for integrations.
